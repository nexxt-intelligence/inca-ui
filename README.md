This is a component library built for Nexxt Intelligence's inca platform.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn storybook`

Runs the storybook app in the development mode.\

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Publishing

Run `yarn changeset` to upgrade the version (whether it be a patch, minor update, or major update).

Then use `git add` on the resulting file in `.changeset/` and commit and push it along with your other changes.

Upon pushing, the package will be automatically published to the npm registry!
